    <h2><span class="h">What is HTML?</span> </h2>
    <p id="MyP"><span id="cl1"><strong>Hypertext Markup Language
         <span id="cl1" class="HTML">(HTML)</span></span></strong> 
         is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
     documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
     <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
    describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
 

    <p><span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
        elements are the building blocks of
        <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
          pages. With <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
           constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
           <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
             provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
              paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span> elements are delineated by <em>tags</em>,
               written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code><span class="tegs">&lt;img/&gt;</code></span> 
               and <code><span class="tegs">&lt;input/&gt;</code></span> 
                directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code><span class="tegs">&lt;p/&gt;</code></span>  surround and provide 
                information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the
                <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2><span class="h">Markup</span></h2>

    <p><span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
    markup consists of several key components, including those called <em>tags</em> 
    (and their <em>attributes</em>), character-based <em>data types</em>, <em>character references</em> 
    and <em>entity references</em>. <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <code><span class="tegs">&lt;h1&gt;</code></span> 
     and <code><span class="tegs">&lt;/h1&gt;</code></span> , although some represent <em>empty elements</em> and so are unpaired, for example 
     <code><span class="tegs">&lt;img/&gt;</code></span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <em>start tag</em>, and the second is the 
     <em>end tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).</p>

    <p>Another important component is the 
        <span class="HTML">(HTML)</span>
        document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
<pre> <span class="code" >
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;<span class="text">This is a title&lt;</span>/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;<span class="text">Hello world!&lt;</span>/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</span>
